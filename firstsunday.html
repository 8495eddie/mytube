            <p>For years Zack Bradley (Dane Cook) has been working hard at hardly working at the local Super Club. That's until a hottie named Amy (Jessica Simpson) becomes the new cashier. After discovering she's willing to date the next guy to become "Employee of the Month",Zack takes on current titleholder (Dax Shepard) in a super-smackdown to see who will win the honor--and Amy's heart-- in this outrageous comedy that proves you can't succeed at life and love till you get your shift together.
